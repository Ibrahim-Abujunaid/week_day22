            My dog Sasha is my best friend.
         She likes to chase the soccer ball when I practice.
          It is so funny to see her' running down the field trying 
          to catch the ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!

                once Sasho saved my life. When I was only 4 years old.
             I started to go into the strest to get a ball that had rolled across the street.
              Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and knocked
               me backwords onto the sidewalk I was mod until I sow the cor go by where I would have been.
             Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I wash
